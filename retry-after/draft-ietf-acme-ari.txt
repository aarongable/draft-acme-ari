                       draft-ietf-acme-ari-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies how an ACME server may provide suggestions to
   ACME clients as to when they should attempt to renew their
   certificates.  This allows servers to mitigate load spikes, and
   ensures clients do not make false assumptions about appropriate
   certificate renewal periods.

1.  Introduction

   Most ACME [RFC8555] clients today choose when to attempt to renew a
   certificate in one of three ways.  They may be configured to renew at
   a specific interval (e.g. via cron); they may parse the issued
   certificate to determine its expiration date and renew a specific
   amount of time before then; or they may parse the issued certificate
   and renew when some percentage of its validity period has passed.
   The first two techniques create significant barriers against the
   issuing Certification Authority (CA) changing certificate lifetimes.
   All three techniques lead to load clustering for the issuing CA.

   Allowing issuing CAs to suggest a period in which clients should
   renew their certificates enables for dynamic time-based load
   balancing.  This allows a CA to better respond to exceptional
   circumstances.  For example, a CA could suggest that clients renew
   prior to a mass-revocation event to mitigate the impact of the
   revocation, or a CA could suggest that clients renew earlier than
   they normally would to reduce the size of an upcoming mass-renewal
   spike.

   This document specifies ACME Renewal Information (ARI), a mechanism
   by which ACME servers may provide suggested renewal windows to ACME
   clients, and by which ACME clients may inform ACME servers that a
   certificate has been renewed and replaced.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Throughout this document, the word "renewal" and its variants are
   taken to encompass any combination of "Renewal", "Re-Key", and
   "Modification" as defined in [RFC3647].

   This document assumes that the certificates being issued by the ACME
   server are in compliance with [RFC5280], and in particular contain
   the Authority Key Identifier extension and the keyIdentifier field
   within that extension.

3.  Extensions to the Directory Object

   An ACME server which wishes to provide renewal information MUST
   include a new field, renewalInfo, in its directory object.

                      | Field       | URL in Value |
                      +=============+==============+
                      | renewalInfo | Renewal info |
                      +-------------+--------------+

       "caaIdentities": ["example.com"],
       "externalAccountRequired": false
     }
   }

4.  Getting Renewal Information

4.1.  The "renewalInfo" Resource

   The "renewalInfo" resource is a new resource type introduced to ACME
   protocol.  This new resource allows clients to query the server for
   suggestions on when they should renew certificates.

   To request the suggested renewal information for a certificate, the
   client sends a GET request to a path under the server's renewalInfo
   URL.

   The path component is a unique identifier for the certificate in
   question.  The unique identifier is constructed by concatenating the
   base64url-encoding [RFC4648] of the bytes of the keyIdentifier field
   of certificate's Authority Key Identifier (AKI) [RFC5280] extension,
   a literal period, and the base64url-encoding of the bytes of the DER
   encoding of the certificate's Serial Number (without the tag and
   length bytes).  All trailing "=" characters MUST be stripped from
   both parts of the unique identifier.

   Thus the full request url is constructed as follows, where the "||"
   operator indicates string concatenation and the renewalInfo url is
   taken from the Directory object:

   url = renewalInfo || '/' || base64url(AKI) || '.' || base64url(Serial)

   For example, to request renewal information for the end-entity
   certificate given in Appendix A, the client would make the request as
   follows:

   1.  The keyIdentifier field of the certificate's AKI extension has
       the hexadecimal bytes
       69:88:5B:6B:87:46:40:41:E1:B3:7B:84:7B:A0:AE:2C:DE:01:C8:D4 as
       its ASN.1 Octet String value.  The base64url encoding of those
       bytes is aYhba4dGQEHhs3uEe6CuLN4ByNQ=.
   2.  The certificate's Serial Number field has the hexadecimal bytes
       00:87:65:43:21 as its DER encoding (note the leading zero byte to
       ensure the serial number remains positive despite the leading 1
       bit in 0x87).  The base64url encoding of those bytes is AIdlQyE=.
   3.  Stripping the trailing padding characters and concatenating with
       the separator, the unique identifier is therefore
       aYhba4dGQEHhs3uEe6CuLN4ByNQ.AIdlQyE, and the client makes the
       request (split onto multiple lines for readability):

   GET https://example.com/acme/renewal-info/
         aYhba4dGQEHhs3uEe6CuLN4ByNQ.AIdlQyE

4.2.  RenewalInfo Objects

   The structure of an ACME renewalInfo resource is as follows:

   suggestedWindow (object, required): A JSON object with two keys,
   "start" and "end", whose values are timestamps, encoded in the format
   specified in [RFC3339], which bound the window of time in which the
   CA recommends renewing the certificate.

   explanationURL (string, optional): A URL pointing to a page which may
   explain why the suggested renewal window is what it is.  For example,
   it may be a page explaining the CA's dynamic load-balancing strategy,
   or a page documenting which certificates are affected by a mass
   revocation event.  Conforming clients SHOULD provide this URL to
   their operator, if present.

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json
   Retry-After: 21600

   {
     "suggestedWindow": {
       "start": "2021-01-03T00:00:00Z",
       "end": "2021-01-07T00:00:00Z"
     },
     "explanationURL": "https://example.com/docs/ari"
   }

   The server SHOULD include a Retry-After header [RFC7231] indicating
   the polling interval that the ACME server recommends.  Servers should
   select a value for this header based on their own operational
   capabilities (e.g. how many requests per second they can handle) and
   the regulatory enviornment in which they operate (e.g. mandated
   revocation timelines).  Conforming clients SHOULD query the
   renewalInfo URL again when the Retry-After period has passed, as the
   server may provide a different suggestedWindow.

   Conforming clients MUST attempt renewal at a time of their choosing
   based on the suggested renewal window.  The following algorithm is
   RECOMMENDED for choosing a renewal time:

   1.  Query the renewalInfo resource to get a suggested renewal window.
   2.  Select a uniform random time within the suggested window.
   3.  If the selected time is in the past, attempt renewal immediately.
   4.  Otherwise, if the client can schedule itself to attempt renewal
       at exactly the selected time, do so.
   5.  Otherwise, if the selected time is before the next time that the
       client would wake up normally, attempt renewal immediately.
   6.  Otherwise, sleep until the Retry-After period has passed, or
       until the next normal wake time, and return to Step 1.

   In all cases, renewal attempts are subject to the client's existing
   error backoff and retry intervals.

   In particular, cron-based clients may find they need to increase
   their run frequency to check ARI more frequently.  Those clients will
   need to store information about failures so that increasing their run
   frequency doesn't lead to retrying failures without proper backoff.
   Typical information stored should include: number of failures for a
   given order (defined by the set of names on the order), and time of
   the most recent failure.

   If the client receives no response or a malformed response (e.g. an
   end timestamp which is equal to or precedes the start timestamp), it
   SHOULD make its own determination of when to renew the certificate,
   and MAY retry the renewalInfo request with appropriate exponential
   backoff behavior.

5.  Extensions to the Order Object

   In order to convey information regarding which certificate requests
   represent renewals of previous certificates, a new field is added to
   the Order object:

   replaces (string, optional): A string uniquely identifying a
   previously-issued certificate which this order is intended to
   replace.  This unique identifier is constructed in the same way as
   the path component for GET requests described above.

   Clients SHOULD include this field in New Order requests if there is a
   clear predecessor certificate, as is the case for most certificate
   renewals.  Clients SHOULD NOT include this field if the ACME Server
   has not indicated that it supports this protocol by advertising the
   renewalInfo resource in its Directory.

   POST /acme/new-order HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Content-Type: application/jose+json

   {
     "protected": base64url({
       "alg": "ES256",
       "kid": "https://example.com/acme/acct/evOfKhNU60wg",
       "nonce": "5XJ1L3lEkMG7tR6pA00clA",
       "url": "https://example.com/acme/new-order"
     }),
     "payload": base64url({
       "identifiers": [
         { "type": "dns", "value": "example.com" }
       ],
       "replaces": "aYhba4dGQEHhs3uEe6CuLN4ByNQ.AIdlQyE"
     }),
     "signature": "H6ZXtGjTZyUnPeKn...wEA4TklBdh3e454g"
   }

   Servers SHOULD check that the identified certificate and the New
   Order request correspond to the same ACME Account, that they share at
   least one identifier, and that the identified certificate has not
   already been marked as replaced by a different Order that is not
   "invalid".  Correspondence checks beyond this (such as requiring
   exact identifier matching) are left up to Server policy.  If any of
   these checks fail, the Server SHOULD reject the new-order request.
   If the Server rejects the request because the identified certificate
   has already been marked as replaced, it MUST return an HTTP 409
   (Conflict) with a problem document of type "alreadyReplaced" (see
   Section 7.4).

   If the Server accepts a new-order request with a "replaces" field, it
   MUST reflect that field in the response and in subsequent requests
   for the corresponding Order object.

   This replacement information may serve many purposes, including but
   not limited to:

   *  granting New Order requests which arrive during the suggested
      renewal window of their identified predecessor certificate higher
      priority or allow them to bypass rate limits, if the Server's
      policy uses such;
   *  tracking the replacement of certificates which have been affected
      by a compliance incident, so that they can be revoked immediately
      after they are replaced; and
   *  tying together certificates issued under the same contract with an
      entity identified by External Account Binding.

6.  Security Considerations

   The extensions to the ACME protocol described in this document build
   upon the Security Considerations and threat model defined in
   [RFC8555], Section 10.1.

   This document specifies that renewalInfo resources MUST be exposed
   and accessed via unauthenticated GET requests, a departure from
   RFC8555's requirement that clients must send POST-as-GET requests to
   fetch resources from the server.  This is because the information
   contained in renewalInfo resources is not considered confidential,
   and because allowing renewalInfo to be easily cached is advantageous
   to shed load from clients which do not respect the Retry-After
   header.
